# Render JSON Challenge

Your challenge for this morning is to render a [large blob of data](/blob.js) taken from reddit.com.

Note that you will be starting from scratch. We did not supply you with any starter code.

**Basic Requirements:**

* Your goal is to create a "gallery view" of the items in the /blob.js `mockData` object, complete with a thumbnail image, and a text description.
* Recommended: Give a shot at using bootstrap to handle your layout! Documentation: [components](getbootstrap.com/components/), [css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).

The end result should look roughly like these screenshots (but feel free to deviate /  get creative):
