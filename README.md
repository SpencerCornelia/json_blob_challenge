Your challenge for this morning is to render a large blob of data taken from reddit.com.

* Your goal is to create a "gallery view" of the items in the json blob, complete with a thumbnail image, and a text description.
* Recommended: Give a shot at using bootstrap to handle your layout! Documentation: [components](getbootstrap.com/components/), [css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).
* The end result should look roughly like this (but feel free to deviate /  get creative):

    ![desktop view](/images/layout_desktop.png)
    ![mobile view](/images/layout_mobile.png)
